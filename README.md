### 3.1 AWS Services
1. ECS Fargate (Elastic Container Service):
    - Scalability: ECS provides automatic scaling, ensuring that the application can handle varying loads efficiently.
    - Fault Tolerance: ECS distributes tasks across multiple instances, minimizing downtime in case of failures.
    - Resource Efficiency: Efficiently utilizes resources, optimizing costs.
    - Pricing: 
        - EC2 Instances: Pay for the EC2 instances used to host the application.
        - ECS: No additional charges for ECS.

2. EC2 Instances:
    - Control: Provides granular control over the EC2 instances hosting the application and database.
    - Customization: Allows the configuration of instance types based on specific requirements.
    - Pricing: 
        Pay for the EC2 instances used to host the application.


### 3.2 AWS Account
- AWS Account ID: [Your AWS Account ID]
- Ensure that the account has the necessary permissions to create and manage ECS clusters, EC2 instances, and other required resources.

### 3.3 AWS Region
- Preferred AWS Region(s): [Specify the AWS region(s) you plan to use]
- Choose a region based on factors such as latency, compliance requirements, and cost considerations.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

### 4.1 GitHub Actions Workflow
Workflow Name: CI/CD Pipeline
Trigger: On every push to the main branch, ensuring continuous integration and deployment.

### 4.2 Build Phase
1. 4.2.1 Checkout Repository
```yaml
Copy code
- name: Checkout repository
 uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

2. 4.2.2 Set up Node.js
```yaml
Copy code
- name: Set up Node.js
 uses: actions/setup-node@v4
 with:
 node-version: 18
```

3. 4.2.3 Install Dependencies
```yaml
Copy code
- name: Install dependencies
 run: npm install
```

4. 4.2.4 Build TypeScript
```yaml
Copy code
- name: Build TypeScript
 run: npm run build
```

### 4.3 Deploy Phase

1. 4.3.1 Deploy to ECS
```yaml
Copy code
- name: Deploy to ECS
 run: |
 # Custom deployment script or ECS-specific action
 # Ensure proper configuration for deployment
```

2. 4.3.2 Database Migration (if applicable)
```yaml
Copy code
- name: Database Migration
 run: |
 # Include commands for database migration after deployment
```

### 4.4 GitHub Actions Configuration Example:
```yaml
Copy code
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
 push:
 branches:
 - main

jobs:
 build:
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest

 steps:
 - name: Checkout repository
 uses: actions/checkout@v2

 - name: Set up Node.js
 uses: actions/setup-node@v4
 with:
 node-version: 18

 - name: Install dependencies
 run: npm install

 - name: Build TypeScript
 run: npm run build

 deploy:
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest

 needs: build

 steps:
 - name: Deploy to ECS
 run: |
 # Add ECS deployment script/command here
 # Update database (if needed)

```

## 5. Database Deployment

### 5.1 PostgreSQL Database
- Performance Control: RDS allows the configuration of database instance types based on specific requirements.
- Configuration Flexibility: Provides flexibility in configuring PostgreSQL based on specific project requirements.
- RDS Pricing:
    - DB Instance Costs: 
        - Instance type: `db.t4g.small (1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM)`.
        - Features: Single-AZ deployment, 30 GB storage, 1GB RAM and 1 vCPU burstable performance, 10 GB backup storage.
        - Pricing: `$16.18 USD per month`.

### 5.2 Database Schema
- Managed within the codebase using a version-controlled approach, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

## 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Decision: No Infrastructure as Code will be used, respecting the project's preference for simplicity and direct configuration.

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

### 7.1 Monitoring Tool
AWS CloudWatch:
- Centralized Monitoring: CloudWatch provides a centralized platform for monitoring various AWS services and applications.
- Auto-Scaling Integration: Seamlessly integrates with auto-scaling policies for dynamic resource allocation.

### 7.2 Configuration
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms to monitor key performance indicators such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and request latency.
- Configure detailed logs for both application and infrastructure components to facilitate effective troubleshooting.

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Access Control
1. AWS IAM Policies:
Define and enforce IAM policies for fine-grained access control, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

- Granular Control: Allows precise control over user access to AWS resources.
- Security Best Practices: Follows security best practices for access management.

### 8.2 Authentication
Secure Authentication Mechanisms: Implement secure authentication mechanisms for sensitive operations, incorporating industry best practices such as multi-factor authentication and secure token management.
- Data Protection: Ensures the protection of sensitive user data.
- Compliance: Helps meet regulatory and compliance requirements.

## 9. Alternatives Considered

### 9.1 Container Orchestration
1. Alternative: Kubernetes (EKS)
Considerations:
- Kubernetes provides a highly extensible platform with a large ecosystem of tools.
- May have a steeper learning curve compared to ECS.

### 9.2 Hosting
2. Alternative: AWS Fargate
Considerations:
- Fargate removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure, offering a serverless container management experience.
- May have cost implications based on usage patterns.

### 9.3 Database
3. Alternative: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)
Considerations:
- RDS simplifies database management tasks, including backups, patch management, and scaling.
- Choice between EC2-hosted PostgreSQL and RDS depends on specific project requirements.

This exhaustive document serves as a detailed guide to the DevOps strategy for Maipic, including the benefits of AWS services and considerations for alternative options. Customize the provided GitHub Actions configuration to match your specific project structure and requirements. Ensure that your AWS account has the necessary permissions, and consider additional security measures based on your specific use case and compliance requirements.
